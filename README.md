Matching algorithm using the scispacy language models.

Please use file - scispacy_loinc_mapping_algorithm.ipynb for using the matchng algorithm

# 🧪 LOINC Mapping Pipeline

This project implements a robust pipeline to map **lab terms** (e.g., _"MCH"_, _"heart rate"_) to their most appropriate **LOINC codes**, using a combination of:

- ✅ **Axis-based matching** (`COMPONENT`, `PROPERTY`, `SYSTEM`, `METHOD`)
- 📊 **LOINC's official `COMMON_TEST_RANK`**
- 🧮 **Custom composite scoring**
- ⚙️ **Batch-based processing** for large-scale performance
- 🛠️ **Hardcoded fallbacks** for known ambiguous terms

The algorithm returns the **best match candidates** for each input term.
